# Introduction
The next chapters endeavor to place the entrepreneur in an organization: where is his or her place in
a complex system of many entities working together and sharing knowledge? What does innovation
mean in a context where the innovator is surrounded by other agents with their own agenda? And if
innovation is a largely unique and personal experience, why is there a need for organizations at all?
Neoclassical economics, the most prevalent branch of economics taught in higher education, with all
its rigorous formulae, is unable to answer these questions. Its impotence lies in the fact that it treats
both human and organizational agents as rational decision-makers, with perfect information about
the market and each other. This view treats market agents much like behaviorism treats people: as
black boxes, with their decisions acting as functions on the input data. And when it comes to reality,
their results may be equally misguided.
In this chapter, we will introduce a different branch of economics called new institutional economics.
If we assume that humans are not perfect, both in their inability to completely assess the world and
in their rather personal hidden decision-making factors, then we will arrive at a much more complex
worldview. This is the theory we will reach out to in order to answer our questions. Subsequently, we
introduce a number of organizational structures developed to cope with this complexity. Finally, we
discuss the impact of these structures on the process of innovation as well as the role of the
entrepreneur within it. To ease the understanding, extensive examples are given where necessary.
